### Convex Hull
The minimum area or volume that encloses all points of a shape

Given n points in a plane
  S = {(xi, yi) | i = 1, 2, ... n}
assume no two have the same x-coord, no two have the same y-coord, no three in a line,
Convex Hull is the smallest convex polygon containing all points in S, referred to as CH(S)

CH(s) is the sequence of points on the boundary in clockwise order as doubly-linked list
